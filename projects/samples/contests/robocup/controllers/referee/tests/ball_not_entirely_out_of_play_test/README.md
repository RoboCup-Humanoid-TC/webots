On this test scenario, we have some robots initially placed outside of the field in valid positions. The ball is going to leave the field from different lines and sides and the autoRef should take appropriate actions, also one goal is going to be scored for each team and the game is going to be a draw:

The following should happen:

1. The robots are spawned and the game state is `INITIAL`.
2. Time elapses and game state changes to `READY`, then `SET`, and then `PLAY`.
3. - Simulation is paused.
   - The robot `Red 1` is manually moved to: `1 0 0.24`.
   - A force of 15 Newton is applied to the ball along X-axis, simulation is resumed.
   - The ball bounces on `Red 1`.
   - Simulation is paused, ball is moved to `1 3 0.08`.
   - A force of 1 Newton is applied on the ball along Y-Axis, simulation is resumed.
   - Ball doesn't entirely leave the field.
   - The game continues without any interference by the AutoRef. ([#16](https://github.com/RoboCup-Humanoid-TC/webots/issues/16))

The following information should be contained in logs (among others):

```
